"""Per-match worker process — the child side of Milestone 4C's
process-per-match concurrency model.

``run_worker`` and ``_process_entry`` must stay top-level, importable
functions (never a closure/lambda/bound method) — Windows has no ``fork``;
``multiprocessing``'s ``spawn`` start method launches a genuinely fresh
Python interpreter for every worker and re-imports this module by name to
find its target, rather than copying the parent's memory. That's also
exactly what gives each worker its own isolated module-level state for
free: a contestant's ``agent.agent`` module is reimported from scratch in
every worker process, so even careless module-level globals (not just a
``create_agent()``-returned instance) never leak between matches.

Only primitive, picklable data crosses the process boundary (``WorkerInput``
below) — confirmed empirically during the 4C design audit that
``AltruAgentClient``/``GameSession``/a client-attached ``Match`` are not
picklable (``httpx.Client`` holds a real ``_thread.RLock``), so nothing here
ever tries to pass one. Each worker builds its own ``AltruAgentClient()``
from its own inherited environment/`.env` (the same config-loading path
every other entry point already uses) rather than receiving the API key
through ``WorkerInput`` at all.
