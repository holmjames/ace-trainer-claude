"""Concurrent multi-match supervisor — the engine behind Milestone 4C's
``python -m agent``.

Non-blocking parent loop: repeatedly discovers this agent's active matches
via ``client.sessions()``, and keeps one independent worker *process*
running per active ``session_id`` (see ``altruagent.worker`` for the child
side, and why processes rather than threads/asyncio — module-level
contestant state and crash isolation both need a real OS-process boundary,
not just a Python-level one).

The parent never plays a match itself. It only starts/tracks/reaps worker
processes and owns the one thing that's meaningless at the per-worker
level: failed-match cooldown. A worker is one-shot (one match, then it
exits) — cooldown is inherently a "should I start a *new* one for this
session_id soon after the last one failed" decision, which only the
long-lived supervisor can make.

Explicitly uses the ``spawn`` multiprocessing context everywhere (never the
platform default) so behavior is identical and Windows-compatible
regardless of what OS this ever runs on — Windows has no ``fork`` at all.

       retried later, which re-requests its grant — the reconnect path).
       Each failure in a row doubles that seat's cooldown, up to
       ``SEAT_FAILURE_BACKOFF_MAX_SECONDS`` (a worker that ran that long
       first starts a new count). A worker that lost the connection to its
       game (``EXIT_CONNECTION_LOST``) after playing for
       ``WORKER_PLAYED_SECONDS`` starts a new count and is replaced after
       ``RESTART_AFTER_PLAY_SECONDS``. A worker that never reached its game
       because of a temporary problem (``EXIT_NOT_CONNECTED``) is replaced
       after ``NOT_CONNECTED_RETRY_SECONDS`` while the connect window is open.
       One turned away by an incomplete registration is retried every
       ``REGISTRATION_RETRY_SECONDS``. One that found the Official Agent Key
       refused (``EXIT_KEY_REFUSED``) makes the runtime say
       ``KEY_REFUSED_MESSAGE`` once and start no new worker from then on (the
       running ones keep playing). A worker that stopped with an error is
       said to have stopped while the match continues, never that the match
       ended; ``WAITING_MESSAGE`` follows only exits after which nothing of
       that game is pending here. A match whose players this runtime plays
       (self-play) gets one "Match finished." when the last of them is done.
    2. List this agent's active assignments. A transient control-plane
       failure is logged and the tick skipped (the runtime keeps waiting).
       So is a temporary failure to sign in again (``is_fatal_auth_error``
       is false), which also pauses listing for a backoff; running workers
       are never touched. An incomplete registration (for example updated
       Official Rules) is not fatal either: the runtime says what to do and
       keeps trying every ``REGISTRATION_RETRY_SECONDS``. Only a refusal of
       the key itself propagates — it would affect every seat.
    3. A seat whose worker had stopped (``TournamentState.stopped``) and that
       has left the list: its match ended without that worker; said once per
       match. Then start one worker per listed seat of a kind in ``kinds``
       (``assignment_kind``: ``TESTING`` and/or ``TOURNAMENT``) that has none
       and isn't cooling down, logging what was picked up
       (``describe_assignment``, once per match however many of its players
       start). A game of another kind is not played; it gets one warning or
       note per game (``_note_other_kind``).
    4. Stop workers whose seat has left the list for
       ``MISSING_POLLS_BEFORE_STOP`` consecutive listings. Every listed seat
       counts here, whatever its kind: ``kinds`` only decides which games
       are started, never stops one already being played.
