"""Concurrent multi-match supervisor — the engine behind Milestone 4C's
``python -m agent``.

Non-blocking parent loop: repeatedly discovers this agent's active matches
via ``client.sessions()``, and keeps one independent worker *process*
running per active ``session_id`` (see ``altruagent.worker`` for the child
side, and why processes rather than threads/asyncio — module-level
contestant state and crash isolation both need a real OS-process boundary,
not just a Python-level one).

The parent never plays a match itself. It only starts/tracks/reaps worker
processes and owns the one thing that's meaningless at the per-worker
level: failed-match cooldown. A worker is one-shot (one match, then it
exits) — cooldown is inherently a "should I start a *new* one for this
session_id soon after the last one failed" decision, which only the
long-lived supervisor can make.

Explicitly uses the ``spawn`` multiprocessing context everywhere (never the
platform default) so behavior is identical and Windows-compatible
regardless of what OS this ever runs on — Windows has no ``fork`` at all.
