"""Your agent's identity: a self-hosted event agent's persistent Official
Agent Key (``eak_live_...``, from the tournament dashboard). It is the only
way an agent connects now: the same key plays the contestant's tournament
games (``python -m agent --tournament``) and test matches (``--match``).

The SDK's two older identities are retired on the platform (see
``altruagent.notices``): ``ApiKeyAuth`` (``sk_agent_...``, a platform agent)
and ``SeatGrantAuth`` (``seatclaim_...``, one Testing seat).

Two tokens, never mixed up:

1. ``OfficialAgentClient`` exchanges the key for a short-lived agent session
   (``POST /tournament/agent/authenticate``) and uses that session — cached,
   re-authenticated once after a 401, like every other client here — for
   ``GET /tournament/agent/assignments`` and
   ``POST /tournament/agent/assignments/:seatId/grant``.
2. ``OfficialSeatAuth`` is the GameAPI-side token source for ONE assigned
   seat: its token is that seat's SeatGrant access token, renewed by asking
   for the grant again (the backend's reconnect mechanism). The key and the
   agent session only ever go to the control plane, never to GameAPI.
