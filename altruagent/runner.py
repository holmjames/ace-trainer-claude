"""Single-match execution primitive — MCP-first.

Owns exactly one match's play loop: fetch state, decide (via contestant-
supplied logic) whether a decision is needed right now, submit it, repeat
until the match ends. This is the ONLY production gameplay path — it plays
through ``MCPGameSession`` (``altruagent.mcp_game``), Agent_ACP's generic
MCP gameplay contract, never the lower-level REST ``GameSession``
(``altruagent.game``, kept only for ``scripts/check_game.py``'s manual
debugging). This file contains no per-game branching (no ``if game_type ==
"pokemon"``/``"avalon"``/...) — every game (OpenSpiel-family or a structured
RuntimeAdapter like Pokémon) is driven through the same four generic
observations: ``is_terminal``, ``phase`` (only the literal value
``"messaging"`` is special-cased), ``is_current_actor``, and
``legal_actions`` — confirmed, not assumed, to be returned under those exact
key names by every adapter currently in Agent_ACP
(``gameapi/src/gameapi/runtime_adapters/{openspiel_adapter,pokemon_adapter}.py``).

The contestant contract is two parameters and a return value, nothing more:

    def choose_action(state: GameState, context: DecisionContext) -> int:
        return state.legal_actions[0]

No base class, no decorator, no registration. `run_match`/`run_game` also
accept an object exposing a `.choose_action(state, context)` method instead
of a plain function, resolved with one `callable()` check and one
`getattr()` — no signature/arity introspection.

`choose_action` may return, and this runner normalizes without ever
guessing or fuzzy-coercing:

    - a `LegalAction` from `state.legal_actions` (`return
      state.legal_actions[0]` is enough for Werewolf and the Pokémon draft,
      but not for Pokémon's Team Preview/doubles templates or Red Alert,
      whose `state.legal_actions` is empty; see GAMES.md)
    - that `LegalAction`'s `action_id` string
    - a plain `int`, ONLY accepted when `str(that int)` exactly equals some
      current legal action's `action_id` (this is what makes OpenSpiel-family
      games' historical `return 0`-style agents keep working unchanged — and
      why it correctly REJECTS an int for a structured game like Pokémon,
      whose action_ids are `"move:0"`, not `"0"`)
    - a structured `dict`, passed straight through as the MCP `action`
      payload for constructive actions (e.g. Pokémon's `submit_team`) that
      can't be enumerated as one of `state.legal_actions` — the SDK performs
      no game-specific validation of it; the server is authoritative
    - `altruagent.RESIGN`
    - `altruagent.WAIT`, only in a real-time game (see below)
    - `altruagent.WithReasoning(<any of the above except RESIGN>, "...")` —
      the same move plus a short public `reasoning_summary`, sent through
      MCP `play_action`'s own optional argument of that name

Turn detection is driven by `GameState.is_current_actor`/`phase`/
`is_terminal` (plus Werewolf's `eliminated` flag) rather than MCP's
`next_actions` hint, so the loop stays independent of hint wording.
`next_actions` is still parsed onto `GameState` but is supplementary/
informational only.

Waiting is a server-side long-poll: when it isn't this agent's turn, the
runner calls `wait_for_update`, which returns as soon as anything changes
(a move, a new message, whose turn it is, the phase, or the game ending).
Each wait lasts at most `WAIT_FOR_UPDATE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (then it simply
waits again); against a server that predates that tool, the runner sleeps
`wait_seconds` and re-reads state instead.

Messaging works the same way: `phase == "messaging"` is the one phase value
this runner recognizes by exact string match; every other phase value (a
future adapter's `"moving"`, `"draft"`, `"teambuild"`, or anything else)
falls through to the identical "it's my turn -> enumerate legal actions ->
choose_action" path with zero adapter-specific code — this is what lets
Pokémon's draft/teambuild phases work without this runner knowing Pokémon
exists. `choose_message` is optional — a contestant that only defines
`choose_action` gets `TERMINATE_MESSAGING` automatically every round (see
`_default_choose_message`), so Werewolf (whose discussion window opens once
per day) can be played move-only with zero new contestant code. `choose_message` is never invoked for a game whose adapter
never reports `phase == "messaging"` (confirmed: Pokémon's phases are
`draft`/`draft_complete`/`teambuild`/`moving`, never `"messaging"`).

Real-time games (a state whose `pacing.mode` is `"realtime"`, e.g. Red
Alert) have no turns: both players are "current" at once and the world keeps
moving while an agent thinks. The loop is the same, with three differences,
all keyed on that pacing field rather than on a game name:

    - `choose_action` may return `altruagent.WAIT`: nothing to send right
      now; the runner waits for the next state (`wait_for_update`, which in
      real time returns as soon as a newer view exists) and asks again.
    - A move the server refuses as a whole (`INVALID_ACTION`, e.g. every
      unit in an order died between the read and the send) is a race, not a
      contestant bug: the runner re-reads the state and continues instead of
      raising `DecisionError`. `RUNTIME_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE` is retried
      after `REALTIME_RETRY_SECONDS`.
    - Before the first decision the runner fetches the game's reference
      (`get_game_config`) once, best-effort, and hands it to decision logic
      as `context.game_config`.

An agent object may also define `on_action_result(result, context)`: the
runner calls it after every `play_action` with the server's answer, or with
`{"error": <code>, "detail": <message>}` when the server refused the move
and the runner recovered. That is how an agent learns that a move it sent
was refused, for any game. It is optional; a plain function agent never
needs it.

`state_version` (MCP's optimistic-concurrency counter) is entirely
runner-owned: taken from the same read that produced `state.legal_actions`
(the server only embeds legal actions whose `state_version` matches the
state's), never something `choose_action`/`choose_message` supply or manage.

    ``RUNTIME_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE`` re-reads it after
    ``REALTIME_RETRY_SECONDS``; ``context.game_config`` is fetched once
    before the first decision. ``on_action_result`` (optional, on the agent
    object) gets every ``play_action`` answer and every recovered refusal.

    A race error (``STALE_STATE``/``NOT_YOUR_TURN``/``WRONG_PHASE``/
    ``GAME_ALREADY_COMPLETE``/``PLAYER_ELIMINATED`` — the state changed
    between our last read and this submit, not a contestant bug) refetches
    state and continues. ``RUNTIME_UNAVAILABLE`` (the adapter doesn't
    actually support a capability the runner expected) raises
    ``UnsupportedGameFlowError``. A contestant-caused messaging/action error
    raises ``DecisionError``. Any other error propagates immediately — no
    retrying.

    Returns the final ``GameState`` once the match is terminal.
