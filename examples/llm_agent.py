"""Example: a general-purpose LLM agent for any AltruAgent game.

    python -m agent --tournament --agent examples.llm_agent

The agent knows the platform contract, not particular games. Every time the
runtime asks it for a decision, it shows the model what GameAPI supplied —
game type, phase, this seat's view of the state, recent messages, and the
current legal options with any server instructions — and has the model
answer through a strict JSON schema built from those options. The answer is
validated again here before anything is sent; GameAPI stays authoritative.

Two kinds of move exist on the platform:

- **Ordinary legal actions** (Werewolf seat choices, Pokémon draft picks,
  and any future game that lists its moves): the model picks one exact
  ``action_id`` from an enum of the current legal actions. Works for new
  games with no code changes.
- **Structured action templates** — a single legal action whose
  ``input["action"]`` describes something to fill in (its ``type`` equals
  the ``action_id``, or it carries ``instructions``), e.g. Pokémon Team
  Preview and doubles turns. These need an adapter that turns the template
  into bounded choices and validates the result (see ``examples/llm/``).
  Adapters are registered by template ``type`` in ``STRUCTURED_ADAPTERS``;
  a template with no adapter raises ``UnsupportedStructuredAction`` rather
  than guessing a payload.

Real-time games are a third kind: no turns, and a move is a batch of orders
sent whenever the agent is ready (Red Alert). A state whose ``pacing.mode``
is ``"realtime"`` goes to the game's real-time player, registered by game
type in ``REALTIME_PLAYERS``; it answers each view with a batch, or
``altruagent.WAIT`` when there is nothing to send, and learns from every
``play_action`` answer through ``on_action_result``. The Red Alert player is
in ``examples/llm/redalert.py``. A real-time game with no player raises
``UnsupportedStructuredAction`` rather than guessing.

Every move carries the model's short public ``reasoning_summary`` via
``altruagent.WithReasoning`` (sent as ``play_action``'s ``reasoning_summary``).
In-game chat is separate: in a messaging phase the runtime calls
``choose_message``, and the model may send one message or end the round,
within a small per-round call budget.

An invalid answer is retried once with the reason; after that the agent
plays a deterministic fallback (logged as FALLBACK): the first legal action,
the adapter's fallback for a template, or ending the discussion round.

Pokémon has clocks (see GAMES.md): Showdown's VGC timer gives 90 s at Team
Preview and 55 s for each battle decision out of a 7-minute bank, and each
draft pick has 15 s. So for Pokémon the model's whole answer, retry
included, must arrive within ``POKEMON_DECISION_SECONDS`` (battle decisions
and Team Preview) or ``POKEMON_DRAFT_SECONDS`` (draft picks); no single
request may run past ``POKEMON_REQUEST_SECONDS``. Out of time, the agent
plays its fallback rather than let the clock run out. Werewolf and Red Alert
are unchanged.

Configuration (environment or the starter's gitignored ``.env``):
``OPENAI_API_KEY`` (required), ``OPENAI_MODEL`` (default ``gpt-4o-mini``),
``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` (optional). The key is never printed or logged.
